## Project Status

**Current Status**: Active Development - Core Architecture Complete  
**Last Updated**: December 2024  
**Target Framework**: .NET Framework 4.8 / .NET 6+  
**Platform Support**: Windows (Primary), Linux/macOS (Planned)

## Architecture

The project is structured as a modular, component-based system with clear separation of concerns:

```
